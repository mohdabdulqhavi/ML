    "1. What is the concept of supervised learning? What is the significance of the name?\n",
    "* Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data to predict outcomes for new, unseen data. The term \"supervised\" refers to the fact that the model is trained with labeled examples and supervised during the learning process.\n",

    "2. In the hospital sector, offer an example of supervised learning.\n",
    "* Supervised learning in the hospital sector can be seen in the use of predictive algorithms to diagnose diseases. For example, a machine learning model can be trained on patient data and symptoms to accurately predict the likelihood of a patient having a specific disease. This type of learning relies on labeled data, with the algorithm being supervised in its learning process.\n",

    "\n",
    "7. In SVM, what is the cost of misclassification?\n",
    "* The cost of misclassification in SVM is the misclassification error rate, which is the percentage of training examples that are incorrectly classified. This error rate is used to determine the penalty for misclassification and is an important factor in the optimization of the SVM model.\n",

    "9. In the SVM model, define the kernel.\n",
    "* Kernel is a mathematical function used to map a lower dimensional data into a higher dimensional space. It can be used for various algorithms such as SVM, K Nearest Neighbour, Logistic Regression etc. In SVM, kernel is used to transform the data into a higher dimensional space to separate the data using a hyperplane. The most common types of kernels are linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF) and sigmoid. Each of these kernels has its own advantages and disadvantages and is used for different scenarios.\n",

It also provides good generalization performance and has a powerful kernel trick for non-linear data. Additionally, it allows for efficient optimization of complex hyper-parameters, making it an ideal choice for many problems.\n",

    "    3. A decision tree with inductive bias\n",
    "* \n",
    "    1. The kNN algorithm has a validation flaw in that it can overfit the data if the k value is not chosen correctly. This means that the algorithm can be too biased towards certain values, leading to poor generalizing ability when used on new data points. It is therefore important to select an appropriate k value for the dataset being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. The k value in the kNN algorithm is a hyperparameter that must be chosen by the user. Choosing the right k value is essential for the algorithm to perform well, as a value that is too small can lead to overfitting, while a value that is too large can lead to underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. A decision tree with inductive bias is a type of decision tree in which the algorithm has an inherent preference for certain types of data points over others.
